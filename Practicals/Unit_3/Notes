-------------------------------Multithreading In JAVA--------------------------------------

Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
So, independent work can be executed simultaneously.
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU. 

Example: Kitchen,waiter,chef
	*waiter will be in ideal ideal situation
	*Main Thread(if no other thread is there,then work will be dome only by one main thread!)

Two ways to create a thread in Java:
1.By implementing Runnable interface
	-Have to provide override definition of run method.
2. By extending Thread class
	-Have to provide override definition of run method.
	
	
*When we call start method then separate call stack will be created for that particular thread.
*When we call run method directly, then it will be stored in current stack[usually in main method stack]
*We should not call run method directly, let JVM execute run() method through start() method by creating separate call stack
*Otherwise it will behave as a simple current thread method
